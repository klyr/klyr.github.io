      <description>CDN: Content delivery network A CDN act as a cache for static ressources of your web server. One famous CDN is Akamai but is quite expensive.
CDN architecture is quite complex with a set of multiple proxies located in multiple datacenters around the world. The goal is to reduce the distance to the minimum between the served ressource and the user asking for the ressource.
A CDN not only saves the bandwith and load of your server but also global Internet peers involved between the client and the server.</description>
